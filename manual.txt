This code is a Python script for capturing and analyzing network traffic using raw sockets. It specifically focuses on Ethernet, IPv4, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols. If you want to run this script on Kali Linux, you can follow these steps:

Install Python:

Ensure that Python is installed on your Kali Linux system. Most Kali Linux installations come with Python pre-installed. You can check the version by running:


python --version

If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager:


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python

Run the Script:

Save the script in a file, for example, network_sniffer.py. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run it with elevated privileges:

sudo python network_sniffer.py

The script uses raw sockets, which typically require elevated privileges. You might be prompted to enter your password.

Capture Network Traffic:

The script will continuously capture and analyze network traffic. You will see output related to Ethernet frames, IPv4 packets, ICMP, TCP, and UDP segments.

Stop the Script:

To stop the script, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

Note: Raw socket operations and packet capturing require administrative privileges, hence the use of sudo. Additionally, be aware of the ethical and legal implications of network packet capturing, and make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform such activities on the network.

Always use such scripts responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized network monitoring or interception of data is illegal in many jurisdictions.
